            <h1>Our Facility</h1>
            <p>Nestled on 15 acres in Southern Maryland, Windmill Equestrian also serves as our family farm. Owned by Jon and Shoshana Haag, the family farm is home to horses, geese, chickens, and a very friendly barn cat named Cole.  Our outdoor arena has lights, and evening lessons are available. </p>

            <h1>Out Trainer</h1>
            <p>Shoshana Haag has a passion for horses that started with riding at age three. She believes that horses should be for everyone and that riding should be safe, fun, and educational. She has been professionally involved in the equestrian world since 15, and has developed her riding and teaching skills in the 20 years since. Shoshana’s goal is to help students acquire the tools for success and build confidence, while learning to appreciate the art and the beauty of a relationship with  horses. By helping students step out of their comfort zone in a safe and positive environment, she allows students to develop skills, connect with horses, and ultimately progress. </p>

            <h1>What to Wear</h1>

We can provide helmets and all tack and equipment for the horse, but bringing your own helmet is encouraged. </p>

            <h1>Cancellation Policy</h1>
            <p>The teacher-student relationship is one that requires mutual respect. If you are unable to make a lesson, whether that be for sickness or personal matters, you must call<strong>24 hours in advance.</strong> Lessons that are not canceled appropriately will not be eligible for a refund or reschedule. </p>
